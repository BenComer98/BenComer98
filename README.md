Hey, I'm Ben Comer, a Software Developer. This is my repository for code projects I'll be doing on the side, usually just for fun.

Right now I'm working on:
-
* Discord bot for customized Dungeons and Dragons campaign and playstyle.
* Code projects from learning languages, concepts (using Udemy).
* Averages app for Fire Emblem (feel free to email for description).

Currently Learning:
-
  * Javascript : On this at the moment...
  * React : ...working in JS and TS alongside this
  * Node.js
  * Typescript : Also on this at the same time...
